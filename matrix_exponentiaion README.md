### Matrix Exponentiation in C++

This program demonstrates how to efficiently raise a matrix to a power using **matrix exponentiation**, a powerful technique used in problems involving recurrence relations — like computing Fibonacci numbers, population growth models, or dynamic programming transitions — in logarithmic time.

###  What's Happening in the Code?

1. **Matrix Multiplication (`matrixMultiplication`)**
   This function takes two matrices `A` and `B` and multiplies them using the standard triple loop approach. It returns the resulting matrix `C = A × B`, provided the dimensions are compatible.

2. **Matrix Exponentiation (`matrixExponentiation`)**
   This function raises a square matrix `A` to an integer power `exp` using **binary exponentiation** (also known as fast exponentiation).

   * We start with an identity matrix `res`.
   * Repeatedly square the matrix `A` and multiply it into `res` whenever the current bit of `exp` is set.
   * This reduces the time complexity from **O(n³·exp)** to **O(n³·log(exp))**, making it highly efficient for large powers.



###  Why Matrix Exponentiation?

Matrix exponentiation is particularly useful when:

* You have a linear recurrence (like Fibonacci: `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`)
* You need the result for large `n` (e.g., `10^9`)
* Brute force or recursion is too slow

It converts a recurrence into matrix form and solves it in logarithmic time using efficient math.
